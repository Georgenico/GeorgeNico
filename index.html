              <h2>I'm George Nico III Manimbo</h2>
              <p>Hi, I have worked as a Website Support Specialist for 1 year and 3 months with Luxury Presence. Initially, I worked as a Data Specialist. My task there was to find a realtor information about their property and upload blog posts and neighborhood descriptions. After 6 months I was promoted to the position of client success.</p>
              <br>
              <p>My task was to create a website. It's template-based and takes tickets, performs minor and major edits on the client's dashboard activate MLS Property, and consult with our clients. Afterward, I was transferred to a department called Zendesk Va. My job was to assist clients with their live websites, sometimes activating their domains through GoDaddy, and to give them access to their assistant to make changes to their owners' websites.</p>
              <br>
              <p>I'm also a former Customer Service in the BPO industry, assisting in making a reservation for guests and verifying the number of rooms, and fulfilling guests' requests. I have basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. I am highly organized, but able to adapt as needs and programs evolve. I am Goal-oriented. </p>
              <br>         
              <p>I am capable of working under any management style, including without supervision. Once I understand the company's objectives and how they want me to achieve them, I can accomplish my goals. Working at a steady pace is usually my norm. I always complete my work ahead of schedule due to my ability to organize and plan my work schedule.</p>
